# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System

# Introduction and Identification of the problem

•	The problem that the project aims to address is the time-consuming and error-prone manual attendance system in educational institutions. Traditionally, attendance is marked on paper, which is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors such as loss of attendance sheets or incorrect entries. This leads to a lack of accurate attendance records, which can have serious consequences for both students and faculty members. To address this problem, the project proposes an automatic system attendance system using face recognition technology. 

•	This system aims to streamline the attendance process by automating it, thereby reducing the time and effort required to mark attendance. Additionally, the system will maintain accurate attendance records, which can be accessed by students and faculty members at any time. This will help in monitoring attendance and taking corrective action, if necessary.
